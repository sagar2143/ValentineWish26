## GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This project is fully compatible with GitHub Pages static hosting.

### Steps to Deploy:
1. **Fork or clone the repository.**
2. **Customize your site:** Edit `customize.json` for your name, wish, and image.
3. **Check file names:** All file and folder names are case-sensitive. For example, use `song1.mp3` (not `Song1.mp3`).
4. **Enable GitHub Pages:** Go to your repo Settings > Pages, select the branch (usually `main`), and `/root` folder.
5. **Access your site:** The URL will be `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>`.

### Troubleshooting
- **404 errors:** Ensure all file names match exactly (case-sensitive).
- **Broken images or music:** Confirm the files exist in the correct folders and use lowercase names.
- **No Babel required:** All scripts use plain JS for compatibility.
- **Custom domain:** You can set a custom domain in GitHub Pages settings.
